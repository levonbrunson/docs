# Documentation Conversion Plan

This file tracks the progress of converting the "Full Repatriation Guide" PDF into Mintlify documentation.

## Phase 1: Setup
- [x] Split PDF into 10-page chunks (`pdf_chunks/`)
- [ ] Initialize `docs.json` structure (if needed)

## Phase 2: Content Migration
We will process the PDF in chunks. For each chunk, we will:
1.  Read the chunk.
2.  Extract content and identify sections.
3.  Create MDX files in `essentials/` (or a more specific subdirectory).
4.  Update `docs.json` to include the new pages.
