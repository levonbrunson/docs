# Accommodations

Finding a home is a top priority. Whether renting or buying, understanding the market is key.

## Finding a Place
*   **Websites**: `list.am`, `estate.am`, `banali.am`, `myrealty.am`.
*   **Agents**: Many agents (local and repat) can help. Find recommendations in Facebook groups like *Repats & Expats: Real Estate in Armenia*.
*   **Neighborhoods**:
    *   *Center (Kentron)*: Expensive, busy, walkable.
    *   *Arabkir/Zeytun*: Residential, good transport.
    *   *Davtashen/Ajapnyak*: Newer buildings, slightly cheaper.
    *   *Nork-Marash*: Hilly, views, cleaner air.

## Renting
*   **Prices**: $300 - $3,000+ depending on location and condition.
*   **Contracts**: Always sign a contract. Notarization is recommended for legal protection.
*   **Payments**: Officially in AMD, though often discussed in USD.
*   **Utilities**: Usually paid by the tenant (gas, water, electricity, internet).

## Buying Property
*   **Process**:
    1.  **Legal Check**: Verify ownership, bans, and history at the Cadastre Committee.
    2.  **Agreement**: Sign a preliminary or final sales contract at a Notary.
    3.  **Registration**: Register ownership at the Cadastre Committee (within 30 days).
*   **Fees**: Property clearance, registration, state duties, and notary fees.
*   **Mortgages**: Available to foreigners (with proof of income). Rates have dropped (7-10% range).

## State Support
Programs exist for families with children buying homes (refunds on income tax for mortgage interest, one-time support for newborns).

## Utilities
*   **Payment**: Easy via terminals (Telcell, EasyPay), banking apps, or HayPost.
*   **Deadlines**: Pay by the 20th of the following month to avoid shutoffs.
