## The System
*   **Yerevan**: Concentrates leading clinics and specialized centers (cardiology, oncology, reproductive health).
*   **Regions**: Infrastructure is less developed but modernizing.
*   **Doctors**: Many have international experience. Russian is widely spoken; English varies (interpreters available).

## Polyclinics
Your primary point of care.
*   **Registration**: Register at the polyclinic nearest your residence with your passport and SSN.
*   **Services**: Family doctors, tests, vaccinations, referrals (*oughegir*) to hospitals.
*   **Cost**: Basic services are often free for registered patients.
