## Moving Money to Armenia
Moving your financial assets to Armenia is relatively straightforward:

    *   *Note: Import and export of local currency is prohibited.*
2.  **Bank Transfer**: For amounts over $10,000, International SWIFT transfers are recommended.
3.  **Money Transfer Services**: Fast transfers via MoneyGram, Unistream, Best, Moneytun (USA-Armenia-USA), Intelexpress, Converse Transfer (Russia-Armenia-Russia), and RIA.
4.  **Online**: Some banks allow opening accounts online.

## Banks in Armenia
There are 18 banks that operate in Armenia. Some are locally owned, some are subsidiaries of international banks. All have competitive advantages, so it's best to shop around for each product offered.

## ATMs and Payments
*   **ATMs** (Bankomats): Found on nearly every street corner throughout the center and connected to every bank branch. Multiple ATM machines are also available in each mall. All ATMs dispense **AMD only**, regardless of your account type. Be aware that withdrawal fees vary by bank and depend on the type of card you have—this is directly correlated with your monthly service fees.
*   **Card Payments**: Accepted in most stores (even small ones selling vegetables and fruits). Visa and Mastercard are standard. Instead of large cash registers, most businesses use small receipt-printing machines called **HDM** (fiscal data module). Most family businesses and even larger ones work this way, though many have also begun offering credit card payment options.
*   **Credit Cards**: Less common than debit cards; high interest rates. Most people use debit cards.

## Currency Exchange
It is recommended to have an app to show you where your nearest exchange offices are located, as well as their rates. There are more options to choose from in the city center, but even outside the center, most supermarkets offer an exchange kiosk. The rates differ based on currency and location.

*   **Apps**: Use `rate.am` to help locate the best banks to exchange at for least loss between currencies.
*   **Locations**: Banks, supermarkets, and exchange kiosks. SAS often has the best rates.
*   **Note**: Most exchange points have similar rates, however.

## Loans
*   **Types**: Consumer, car, student, mortgage, business.
*   **Guarantors**: Often required. A guarantor must be:
    *   A legal adult.
    *   At least a special residency if not citizenship, and legally registered in Armenia.
    *   Has a steady income.
    *   Available in person to sign with you at the bank.
    *   **Required documents**: ID, a document from the workplace, and anything else the bank specifically needs.
*   **Guarantor Responsibilities**: The guarantor essentially ensures the one taking out the loan will be responsible and pay on time, agreeing to take on all the responsibility should the loan receiver default. This includes paying interest, court fees, and damages.
*   **Risks**: The risks include losing the guarantor's own assets. It could also negatively impact the guarantor's own loan history, making it harder to receive one in the future.
*   **Guarantor Rights**: 
    *   The guarantor can appeal the charges, no matter the response from the loan receiver.
    *   The guarantor may also demand damages paid from the loan receiver.

## Savings Accounts
One of the best passive income avenues available in Armenia are the high interest savings accounts. Each bank is different in the interest rate they offer, however the overall trend is that AMD has the highest return, the USD is second highest, and the Euro is lowest. Some banks have extremely low rates, so it is best to shop around.

While it is considered riskier, AMD has been more or less consistent since the beginning, and certainly as of the 2000s. It is comparable with some of the more stable currencies, such as the USD and Japanese Yen.

*   **Interest Rates**: AMD accounts offer the highest rates (up to ~10%), followed by USD, then EUR.
*   **Tax**: 10% income tax is deducted from interest earned.
*   **Examples** (approximate as of 2025):
    *   *Acba*: 5-11% (AMD)
    *   *Araratbank*: ~9% (AMD)
    *   *Artsakhbank*: ~8.5% (AMD)
    *   *Amio*: ~8.75% (AMD)
    *   *Converse*: ~8.8-9% (AMD, Privé)
    *   *Evocabank*: ~8% (AMD)
    *   *ID Bank*: 4.55-10% (AMD)
    *   *Inecobank*: 4.5-9.25% (AMD)
    *   *VTB*: Up to 9.5% (AMD)
