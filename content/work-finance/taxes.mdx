    *   5% for salaries up to 500,000 AMD.
    *   10% for salaries above 500,000 AMD (capped at 25,000 AMD max contribution).

## Freelancer Taxes

While you might have heard that freelancers do not pay taxes, there is strong advice to properly organize the legal and taxation side of your freelance activity.

### IT Professionals
By acquiring a certificate in the IT field, a developer can take advantage of:
*   **10% income tax rate** (instead of 20%)
*   **Zero VAT rate** for export of services

**Benefits include:**
*   Legal business status
*   International recognition
*   Pension savings
*   Lower costs by using bank accounts instead of money transfer systems

### Fixed Payment Mode
Trainers of various narrow-profile courses, heads of dance clubs, craftsmen, and other self-employed people have the opportunity to use the **fixed payment mode**, which is paid once a quarter instead of regular tax payments.

### Licensing Requirements
Freelancers can easily, quickly, and affordably legalize their business by receiving a license corresponding to their occupation, **provided that their annual revenue does not exceed 9 million drams**.

For more information, please refer to the **RA Law on tax privileges for self-employed persons**.
