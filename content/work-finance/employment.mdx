# Employment in Armenia

Finding a job is a top priority for most repatriates.

## Job Search Resources
*   **Repat Armenia Careers**: Quality jobs with reasonable pay (>$500).
*   **Facebook Groups**: *Jobs for Repats and Expats in Armenia*, *HR.AM CLUB*, *Գործ Կա*.
*   **Job Sites**: `staff.am`, `careercenter.am`, `jobfinder.am`, `hire.am`, `job.am`.
*   **Networking**: Crucial in Armenia. Talk to people and attend events. The more people you meet, the easier your integration process will be.

## Application Tips
When applying for a job, please follow these instructions:

1.  **Diplomas**: Bring your diplomas and certificates. While most may not ask to see them, some international institutions, especially, will require originals.
2.  **Resumes**: Most Armenian companies use an American style as template and prefer single page attachments to your email. However, please make sure you research the company you're applying to and match their needs.
3.  **Networking**: Actively network. The more people you meet, the easier your integration process will be. Update your LinkedIn, join relevant Facebook groups (HR.AM CLUB, Jobs for repats and expats in Armenia, Գործ Կա) and try to attend repat and expat events in town.
4.  **Language**: It is recommended to learn Armenian once you arrive, at least on a conversational level, to compliment your English proficiency. You may want to pick up some Russian, as well. This greatly increases your chances of being hired to just about any position that might require contact with Russian-speakers.

## Networking and Integration
Do active networking with repatriates and locals because it will help you to be smoothly integrated. The Armenian Repatriates Network, which is a Facebook private group, was created as a space for collectively promoting repatriation, supporting successful integration and facilitating a more pro-repatriation environment in Armenia.
