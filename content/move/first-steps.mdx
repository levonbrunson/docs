# Recommended First Steps After Arrival

Once you land, there are several administrative tasks to tackle to ensure a smooth transition.

## 1. Visit Repat Armenia
Visit **Repat Armenia Foundation** for repatriation advice and any repatriation-related questions. Also, we suggest joining the **Armenian Repatriates Network** (12,000 members) for practical tips on different aspects of repatriation and a "soft landing".

**Repat Armenia Foundation**
*   **Tel**: +374 91 46 46 60
*   **Email**: repatriation@repatarmenia.org
*   **Website**: [www.repatarmenia.org](http://www.repatarmenia.org)
*   **Address**: Near Republic Square (Contact us for details)

## 2. Get a SIM Card & Internet
Choose a mobile/internet provider among the three mobile phone service providers in Armenia: **UCom**, **Viva**, and **Team Telecom**. All three have generally good coverage in Yerevan and around Armenia. You might lose signal for a while when around mountains, but you are mostly connected.

**Mobile Plans:**
*   Two options: **monthly plan** or **pay-as-you-go** for cell phones
*   Plans are inexpensive, starting at **1,000 AMD prepaid**
*   Monthly plans range from **1,900 - 9,500 AMD** ($5-25/month)

**Home Internet:**
*   Available through **UCom**, **Team Telecom**, and **Ovio**
*   All offer a combo of internet/phone/television
*   Plans start from **6,000 AMD** for just internet

<Note>
You will need to bring your passport or other ID in with you when applying for any service.

If you don't have grantsoum (address registration), you will be asked for a deposit payment on internet modems.
</Note>

## 3. Open a Bank Account
Opening a bank account is a general necessity. In Armenia, it is used to:
*   Deposit your money (most have at least two accounts - AMD + USD/EUR/RUB)
*   Get paid or receive government-provided benefits
*   Pay for utilities alongside daily purchases

**Process:**
*   **Documents**: Passport, Social Security Number (SSN), and sometimes proof of registered address (*grantsoum*).
*   **At the Bank**: All banks have kiosks where you take a number based on your needs. Wait for your number to appear on the screen.
*   **Tips**: 
    *   Use the [**Earlyone app**](https://earlyone.com/mobile-application) to book appointments and avoid wait times. 
    *   Banks in the city center are busier; try smaller branches or off-peak hours (morning or around 3 PM).
    *   Expect longest wait times around lunch and closing.

<Note>
Use mobile or online banking where possible. Contact us if you need to open a bank account; we will connect you with our partner bank.

For more information about the banking system in Armenia, insurance, currency exchange, etc., please refer to the [Financials section](/work-finance/financials).
</Note>

## 4. Register Your Residence (*Grantsoum*)
Do this as soon as you have your residency card or citizenship. It is not complex but can be time-consuming.

<Note>
You should [book an appointment online](https://migration.e-gov.am/en/) for this service.
</Note>

1.  Go to your local police station with your card/passport.
2.  Fill out the form with your address and phone number.
3.  A police officer will visit your home (usually within a week) to verify you live there (without prior notification).
4.  Pick up your stamped card/passport at the station.

**Important Notes:**
*   **Contracts**: You need a notarized rent contract. Inform your landlord beforehand.
*   **Deadlines**: When changing residences, you must notify the territorial authorities **within a week** of the change. You can only be registered at one address at a time.
*   **Landlord Issues**: Sometimes landlords have concerns about rights limitations. If this happens, refer to your district police station or contact lawyers to help resolve the issue.

## 5. Obtain a Social Security Number (SSN)
Obtain a Social Security Number (SSN) once you have received the official stamp in your passport verifying your registered address (also known as a grantsoum). You will have to approach the same station for your social security number and show your grantsoum and they will prepare the necessary paperwork.

*   **Where**: The same police station where you registered your address. You can also get it at the main visa and passport department in **Davtashen** (17/10, Davtashen, 4th District).
*   **Bring**: Passport with registered address stamp.

**PRO TIP:** Scan and file your documents digitally as you will only need the number in most cases, but a photo of the original might get you through if they request the actual document.

<Note>
You should [book an appointment online](https://migration.e-gov.am/en/) for this service. Davtashen office can be crowded by 9:00 AM; consider less crowded alternatives like Kanaker-Zeytun or Nubarashen offices.
</Note>

**You will need your SSN for:**
*   Opening bank accounts
*   Obtaining various licenses
*   Paying taxes / receiving a salary
*   Poverty family benefits
*   Unemployment benefits
*   Old age pensions
*   Disability pensions
*   Any other government assistance programs

## 6. Healthcare Registration
Register at your local **polyclinic** for free basic services.

<Note>
You should [book an appointment online](https://migration.e-gov.am/en/) for this service.
</Note>

1.  Find your nearest polyclinic (see [Medical section](/living/medical) for full list and addresses).
2.  Bring passport/residency card and SSN.
3.  Sign an agreement with the polyclinic, marking you their patient.

**Coverage includes:**

*   Emergency care and transportation
*   In-patient treatment
*   Outpatient treatment
*   Cardiology & Angiosurgery
*   Partial oncology and chronic diseases
*   Pregnancy and childbirth
*   Preventative examinations
*   Drugs and medical supplies
*   Ophthalmological services
*   Dental services

**Medical Insurance**: 

As for medical insurance, in Armenia it is not that common to have it on an individual basis. Thus, it is more affordable and beneficial for you to be included in a corporate package. Repat Armenia Foundation has been working hard for years, bringing a group insurance package to repatriates looking to protect themselves in emergency situations. Since 2019, we have been working with **Nairi Insurance** to offer comprehensive coverage at a lower price.

*   **Cost**: 130,000 AMD annually and 30% less with a family of 3+, it covers up to 7 million AMD in medical bills in Armenia.
*   **Apply**: [Click here to apply for insurance coverage](https://www.repatarmenia.org/services-and-programs/health-insurance-package).

## 7. Improve Your Armenian
