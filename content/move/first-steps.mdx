# Recommended First Steps After Arrival

Once you land, there are several administrative tasks to tackle to ensure a smooth transition.

## 1. Visit Repat Armenia
Visit **Repat Armenia Foundation** for repatriation advice and any repatriation-related questions. Also, we suggest joining the **Armenian Repatriates Network** (12,000 members) for practical tips on different aspects of repatriation and a "soft landing".

## 3. Open a Bank Account
Opening a bank account is a general necessity. In Armenia, it is used to:
*   Deposit your money (most have at least two accounts - AMD + USD/EUR/RUB)
*   Get paid or receive government-provided benefits
*   Pay for utilities alongside daily purchases

**Process:**
*   **Documents**: Passport, Social Security Number (SSN), and sometimes proof of registered address (*grantsoum*).
*   **At the Bank**: All banks have kiosks where you take a number based on your needs. Wait for your number to appear on the screen.
*   **Tips**: 
    *   Use the [**Earlyone app**](https://earlyone.com/mobile-application) to book appointments and avoid wait times. 
    *   Banks in the city center are busier; try smaller branches or off-peak hours (morning or around 3 PM).
    *   Expect longest wait times around lunch and closing.

<Note>
Use mobile or online banking where possible. Contact us if you need to open a bank account; we will connect you with our partner bank.

## 4. Register Your Residence (*Grantsoum*)
Do this as soon as you have your residency card or citizenship. It is not complex but can be time-consuming.

</Note>

1.  Go to your local police station with your card/passport.
2.  Fill out the form with your address and phone number.
3.  A police officer will visit your home (usually within a week) to verify you live there (without prior notification).
4.  Pick up your stamped card/passport at the station.

**Important Notes:**
*   **Contracts**: You need a notarized rent contract. Inform your landlord beforehand.
*   **Deadlines**: When changing residences, you must notify the territorial authorities **within a week** of the change. You can only be registered at one address at a time.

## 5. Obtain a Social Security Number (SSN)
Required for work, banking, and benefits.
*   **Where**: The same police station where you registered your address. You can also get it at the main visa and passport department in **Davtashen** (17/10, Davtashen, 4th District).
*   **Bring**: Passport with registered address stamp.
*   **Tip**: Keep a digital scan of your SSN document; you usually only need the number.
