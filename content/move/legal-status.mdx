# Legal Status in Armenia

As a foreign citizen in Armenia, there are many things you are entitled to, and many things expected of you. You may work in Armenia (provided you have a work permit, which leads to temporary residency), own a business, and rent or own property. You are expected to pay taxes, state duties, and any other payments specified by law, while respecting and following the country's constitution and regulations.

However, you may not:
- Enter the country without a visa (unless otherwise specified by law)
- Vote or be elected to state bodies
- Work in public services
- Own agricultural land
- Create or become a member of a local political party

## Types of Residence Permits

There are three main types of residency status: Temporary, Permanent, and Special. Foreigners who wish to obtain residency could qualify for either, depending on their circumstances. If you are not of Armenian descent, the best paths are typically through education, business, or investment.

| Type | Duration | Cost | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Temporary** | 1 year (extendable) | 105,000 AMD | Requires medical checkup. |
| **Permanent** | 5 years (extendable) | 140,000 AMD | Requires medical checkup. |
| **Special** | 10 years (extendable) | 150,000 AMD | Often for those of Armenian descent. |

### Application Requirements

*   **Passport**: Notarized translation + 3 copies.

**Processing Time**: The decision about granting temporary or permanent residency is made by the Migration and Citizenship Service of Armenia, jointly with the National Security Services, within 30 days. A notice will be sent to the applicant. Once granted, the holder has the right to live in Armenia, as well as exit and enter the country. A renewal should be applied for 30 days before the expiration date.

<Note>You should book an appointment for applying for any type of residence permit on the [Migration and Citizenship Service website](https://migration.e-gov.am/en/).</Note>

### Family Residency Permits

Families of Armenian citizens and residents may receive permits based on the sponsor's current status:

- **Temporary status holders** may apply for residency permits for their spouse, parent, or child.
- **Permanent residents** may apply for spouse, parent, child, siblings, grandparents, or grandchildren to receive temporary residency.
- **Special residents and citizens** may apply for spouse, parents, children, siblings, grandparents, and grandchildren, with permanent residency options available after three years.

## Special Residency (for Armenians)

As of 1994, Armenia issues a special residency passport (88x125mm, 12 page) to foreign citizens of Armenian ancestry. It is for a 10-year period and exempts the bearer from visa costs when travelling to Armenia. It provides full protection by the law and all rights and obligations of Armenian citizens, as well as most benefits, with the exception of the right to vote or run for office. Furthermore, those with the special residency passport are exempt from military service.

### Application Process

To apply, you will need to submit the necessary documentation to either an embassy or consulate when outside Armenia, or through the Passport and Visa Department (aka OVIR). The processing time can take between 3 and 6 months, though it has been known to take up to 9 in some cases. Renewal applications should be made 30 days before the expiration date.

<Note>You should book an appointment for applying for any type of residence permit on the [Migration and Citizenship Service website](https://migration.e-gov.am/en/).</Note>

<Note>Those over the age of 16 can apply for special residency. The children of special residents who are under 16 may receive special residency for free.</Note>

## Residency for Non-Armenians

Yes, you can apply for both 1 year and 5 year residency. Normally, these are granted based on your circumstances, as mentioned above. The 1-year is temporary, while the 5-year is considered permanent. You become eligible for citizenship three years after your initial issuance. 

Foreign citizens enrolled in an Armenian school or university are issued a temporary residence permit. Employees with a signed employment agreement are also eligible for a temporary residency. You are not allowed to work without a permit and it may result in both penalties and visa revocation.

## Citizenship

Any person 18+ can apply for Armenian citizenship. Dual citizenship is allowed. Terms of acquiring or terminating citizenship are settled upon the Law of the Republic of Armenia on "Citizenship of the Republic of Armenia" and Governmental Decision N 1390-N (November 23, 2007). 

Citizenship is granted by decree of the President of the Republic of Armenia. Armenian citizenship can be awarded without requirements to persons who have provided exceptional service to the Republic of Armenia.

**Important:** You cannot buy Armenian citizenship through investment programs, unlike in many other countries.

### Benefits of Armenian Passport

After three years of residence in Armenia, or if you are of Armenian descent, you may apply for citizenship, thus becoming eligible for a travel passport. Ranked 66th in the world, the Armenian passport allows for visa-free travel to 80 countries, including Russia, most of the CIS, and Iran. You are allowed dual citizenship and need not renounce your original one.

### Benefits of Residency

Residency alone gives you the right to do business, work, study, or simply retire in Armenia. Residents may also invite foreigners. Though a citizen must serve in the military, residents alone are not obligated.

3. The citizen, whose parent or sibling lost their life during the defense of the Republic of Armenia or during the performance of their military duties in the armed forces, and he is the only male child of the family.

</Note>

### Military Service Registration

Males subject to military service can register on the [Ministry of Defense website](http://www.mil.am) in Armenia, or at the embassies and consular offices of Armenia in foreign countries. In all cases, the applicant fills an application in Armenian, without corrections. All documents in foreign languages must be translated into Armenian and must have notary authentication.

**RA Ministry of Defense**
*   **Address**: Bagrevand 5, Yerevan
*   **Phone**: +374-12-210000
*   **Website**: [mil.am](http://www.mil.am)

## Apostille

An apostille stamp legally confirms the position, signature, seal and stamp on official documents. Introduced in the Hague Convention of 1961, it authenticates documents for use in foreign countries.

### Which Documents Require Apostille?

Apostilles are required for:

*   Documents issued by notary offices, including certificate of inheritance
*   Documents issued by the RA registrar (birth, death, marital status certificates)
*   Documents issued by courts and their service departments (enforcement orders, judgements, court decisions and sentences)
*   Documents certified and issued by other state bodies

**Not apostilled:**
*   Documents from consular and diplomatic agents
*   Documents for commercial practices

### How Apostilles Are Applied

The apostille stamp is placed directly on documents such as certificates, diplomas, university degrees or court orders, but on a separate sheet attached in the case of documents about civil status. It will contain a headline and content in the language of the country it will be used in.

### Getting an Apostille in Armenia

Apostilles are issued by the **Registry Offices of the Ministry of Justice** in Armenia. 

**Requirements:**
*   Application
*   Original and a copy of the documents requiring the apostille
*   Receipt of payment: **7,000 AMD** to state account number **900005163523**

**Timeline:**
*   **Standard**: 2-5 working days (delays up to 15 days may occur, but you will receive a notice with reasons)
*   **Expedited**: For applications received before 13:00, combined with extra payment (additional 8,000 AMD for a total of **15,000 AMD**), you may receive your apostilled document back the following morning from 10 AM

Anyone can apply for an apostille.

### Apostille vs. Consular Legalization

In theory, consular legalization and apostilles are equal in strength. However, consular legalization is more complex, requiring translations and notary signatures before further certification by state bodies.

### Foreign Documents for Use in Armenia

Foreign documents that are to be used in Armenia must be legalized in the country of their origins, then legalized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Armenia, or such other authorities.
