# Planning Your Move to Armenia

Proper planning is essential for a smooth transition. Follow these steps to prepare for your repatriation.

## Step 1: Contact Repat Armenia
Reach out to us for advice and planning.
- **Tel**: +374 91 46 46 60
- **Email**: repatriation@repatarmenia.org
- **Website**: [www.repatarmenia.org](http://www.repatarmenia.org)

We also recommend joining the **Armenian Repatriates Network** (12,000+ members) for practical tips and community support.

## Step 2: Plan a Pilot Trip
A pilot trip is highly recommended to discover opportunities. Repat Armenia can organize meetings with:
- Experienced repats
- Public institutions
- Recruiters
- Business consulting and legal agencies
- Educational institutions

Consider volunteering programs like [**Birthright Armenia**](https://birthrightarmenia.org/) or [**Armenian Volunteer Corps**](https://armenianvolunteer.org/) to experience the country from the inside.

## Step 3: Prepare Documents
Gather your documents and their copies. Keep your originals safe.
**Essential documents to bring:**
- Birth certificate (translated and notarized)
- Baptism certificate (translated and apostilled if necessary)
- Education certifications (translated and notarized)
- Marriage certificate (translated and apostilled if necessary)
- Criminal record (apostilled) document for the Vienna convention
- Driver's license (international unless part of the Vienna convention)
- Vaccination documentation

<Note>
Documents should be translated and notarized either in your country of origin or in Armenia. Pay special attention to the **apostille** process, as it must be done in the country of origin.
</Note>

## Step 4: Choose Your Legal Status
Decide whether you will apply for **residency** or **citizenship**. You can start this process in your current country or after arriving in Armenia.
*See the Legal Status section for more details.*

## Step 5: Moving Personal Belongings
Check the procedures for importing your goods.
**What you can bring tax-free:**
- Used personal and household items (no original packaging).
- Max 3 of each electronic item (must show wear/tear).
- 1 complete set of furniture per room type.
- 1 car for personal use (owned for at least 6 months prior).
- Unlimited personal items (clothing, books, bedding).

*See the Moving Your Personal Belongings section for detailed rules.*

## Step 6: Moving Financial Assets
Moving your financial assets to Armenia may seem somewhat difficult to do but there are easy ways to do it:
1.  **Cash**: You can bring up to **$10,000** (or equivalent) without declaration. Amounts over $10,000 must be declared.
    <Note>Import and export of local currency is prohibited.</Note>
2.  **Bank Transfer**: Recommended for amounts over $10,000 via International SWIFT transfers.
3.  **Money Transfer Services**: MoneyGram, Unistream, Best, Moneytun (USA-Armenia-USA), Intelexpress, Converse Transfer (Russia-Armenia-Russia), and RIA.
4.  **Online Accounts**: Some banks allow opening accounts online.

## Step 7: Improve/Learn Armenian
Armenian (Eastern) is the official language, although knowledge of Russian and English will also be helpful.
**Ways to learn:**
1.  **Online**: There are several websites you can use to learn Armenian, as well as apps, depending on your level and commitment to the language. Try the [**Armenian Virtual College**](https://www.avc-agbu.org/) which offers a variety of courses to help you in the process or download [**AYOlingo application**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ayolingo-learn-armenian/id1367151083) ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.birthrightarmenia.ayolingo)).
2.  **Private Lessons**: While more expensive, it could be great. Thankfully, especially since there are many opportunities to take lessons in the country, you can look for relevant offers on our network.
3.  **Media**: Read Armenian books and newspapers. Armenian language newspapers and books, whether online or in print, are available in different genres, from Armenian classics to translated works of contemporary authors.
4.  **Watch Armenian television**: If you like drama, Armenian series are great. If you are interested in Armenian music competitions, Radio is also an option. Much of the YouTube channel is available.
5.  **Free Classes**: Follow [Repat Armenia language courses](https://www.repatarmenia.org/services-and-programs/armenian-language-courses) or check out more resources from the [**Office of the High Commissioner for Diaspora Affairs**](https://english.hartak.am/services/40b8ba7e-5f81-43f5-b33d-493bd88bee12/online/) ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DiasporaGovAm)) for online classes and tutors.

## Step 8: Employment & Business
Start searching for employment/business opportunities. This is the most important aspect for most, and where most of your efforts should go. The earlier you begin the search process, the greater the likelihood of success in securing financial sustainability and a job that fits your needs and experience.

Start doing research in advance on what the job market is like, salaries, and your position within it. Have an idea of jobs in-demand, and the required qualifications. For more information please refer to the Employment section.

**PRO TIP**: Be flexible in the job search process by taking into consideration areas close to your major and/or things related to the skillset of your skills. You can get more tips in this section.

**NOTE**: Armenian companies are not in the habit of long-distance recruitment. If they raise an employee, they expect you to hire immediately. At the most, you'll have 2 weeks before you should be ready to begin.
