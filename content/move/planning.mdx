# Planning Your Move to Armenia

Proper planning is essential for a smooth transition. Follow these steps to prepare for your repatriation.

## Step 1: Choose Your Legal Status
Decide whether you will apply for **residency** or **citizenship**. You can start this process in your current country or after arriving in Armenia.
*See the Legal Status section for more details.*

## Step 2: Prepare Documents
Gather your documents and their copies. Keep your originals safe.
**Essential documents to bring:**
- Birth certificate (translated and notarized)
- Baptism certificate (translated and apostilled if necessary)
- Education certifications (translated and notarized)
- Marriage certificate (translated and apostilled if necessary)
- Driver's license (international unless part of the Vienna convention)
- Vaccination documentation

<Note>
Documents should be translated and notarized either in your country of origin or in Armenia. Pay special attention to the **apostille** process, as it must be done in the country of origin.
