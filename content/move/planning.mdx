# Planning Your Move to Armenia

Proper planning is essential for a smooth transition. Follow these steps to prepare for your repatriation.

## Step 1: Contact Repat Armenia
Contact Repat Armenia Foundation for repatriation advice and to plan your repatriation process. Also, we suggest joining the **Armenian Repatriates Network** (+12,000 members) for soft landing and practical tips on different aspects of repatriation. The more you know in advance, the more likely you are to plan effectively and create a positive experience for yourself and your family.

## Step 2: Plan a Pilot Trip
Plan your pilot trip which is highly recommended to discover opportunities in Armenia. Once you contact us, we get to know your needs/request, expectations, and based on that we connect you with the relevant public institutions, potential recruiters, business consulting and legal agencies, educational institutions, and experienced repatriates matching your needs/request. This will help you with the proper planning of your move and soft landing. You can also consider taking part in our hands on volunteering programs like [**Birthright Armenia**](https://birthrightarmenia.org/) or [**Armenian Volunteer Corps**](https://armenianvolunteer.org/).

## Step 3: Prepare Documents
Prepare a set of documents and its copies and make sure you have your originals. Please, gather your documents before moving, so you will be able to seamlessly do paperwork with less burden once you arrive (education, registration, legal status, employment options, and accommodations).

Make sure you take all these five boxes following:
- Birth certificate (translated and notarized)
- Baptism certificate (translated and apostilled if necessary)
- Education certifications (translated and notarized)
- Marriage certificate (translated and apostilled if necessary)
- Criminal record (apostilled) document for the Vienna convention
- Driver's license (international unless part of the Vienna convention)
- Vaccination documentation

<Note>
These documents shall be translated, notarized either in the country you are coming from, or in Armenia. Please pay special attention to the apostilling process as it has to be done in the country you are coming from.
</Note>

## Step 4: Choose Your Legal Status
Choose your legal status in Armenia. You can apply for residency in Armenia or citizenship either in your country where you currently reside or once you arrive in Armenia. For more detailed information about the process please refer to the [Legal Status in Armenia section](/move/legal-status).

## Step 5: Moving Personal Belongings
Check the procedures of moving personal belongings before you arrive in Armenia.

Repatriates who have permanent residency status (spent at least 915 days (last 5 years) outside of Armenia for the last 5 years or has a permanent residency holder outside of Armenia) can bring tax-free used personal and household items with no original factory packaging and labelling that should arrive to Armenia within 18 months.

Things you can easily bring are:
- 3 maximum of each electronic piece used for personal and daily purposes, as long as it's not new and in original boxes. It must show some wear and tear.
- 1 complete set of each type of furniture only for personal use
- 1 car for personal use that you can prove you have owned for at least 6 months prior to moving
- Unlimited personal items that you can prove you brought in without fund (this includes, clothing, home accessories, bedding, books, and such items. Please DON'T bring paper, tissues, etc.)

The goods can be imported tax-free within 18 months since obtaining permanent residence or special residency in Armenia. The date of "arrival for permanent residence" is the date when the repatriate registers his/her address with the police. If the address had already been registered, the day of filing a statement with the customs office is considered the "day of arrival for permanent residence." The repatriate must file an application for tax-free import with the customs office (on paper or electronically) specifying the name, weight and number of items imported. The customs office has up to 3 working days to grant or reject the application.

*See the [Moving Your Personal Belongings section](/move/moving-belongings) for detailed rules.*

## Step 6: Moving Financial Assets
Moving your financial assets to Armenia may seem somewhat difficult to do but there are easy ways to do it:
1.  **Cash**: You can bring up to **$10,000** (or equivalent) without declaration. Amounts over $10,000 must be declared.
    <Note>Import and export of local currency is prohibited.</Note>
2.  **Bank Transfer**: Recommended for amounts over $10,000 via International SWIFT transfers.
3.  **Money Transfer Services**: MoneyGram, Unistream, Best, Moneytun (USA-Armenia-USA), Intelexpress, Converse Transfer (Russia-Armenia-Russia), and RIA.
4.  **Online Accounts**: Some banks allow opening accounts online.

## Step 7: Improve/Learn Armenian
Armenian (Eastern) is the official language, although knowledge of Russian and English will also be helpful.
**Ways to learn:**
1.  **Online**: There are several websites you can use to learn Armenian, as well as apps, depending on your level and commitment to the language. Try the [**Armenian Virtual College**](https://www.avc-agbu.org/) which offers a variety of courses to help you in the process or download [**AYOlingo application**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ayolingo-learn-armenian/id1367151083) ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.birthrightarmenia.ayolingo)).
2.  **Private Lessons**: While more expensive, it could be great. Thankfully, especially since there are many opportunities to take lessons in the country, you can look for relevant offers on our network.
3.  **Media**: Read Armenian books and newspapers. Armenian language newspapers and books, whether online or in print, are available in different genres, from Armenian classics to translated works of contemporary authors.
4.  **Watch Armenian television**: If you like drama, Armenian series are great. If you are interested in Armenian music competitions, Radio is also an option. Much of the YouTube channel is available.
5.  **Free Classes**: Follow [Repat Armenia language courses](https://www.repatarmenia.org/services-and-programs/armenian-language-courses) or check out more resources from the [**Office of the High Commissioner for Diaspora Affairs**](https://english.hartak.am/services/40b8ba7e-5f81-43f5-b33d-493bd88bee12/online/) ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DiasporaGovAm)) for online classes and tutors.

## Step 8: Employment & Business
Start searching for employment/business opportunities. This is the most important aspect for most, and where most of your efforts should go. The earlier you begin the search process, the greater the likelihood of success in securing financial sustainability and a job that fits your needs and experience.

Start doing research in advance on what the job market is like, salaries, and your position within it. Have an idea of jobs in-demand, and the required qualifications. For more information please refer to the Employment section.

**PRO TIP**: Be flexible in the job search process by taking into consideration areas close to your major and/or things related to the skillset of your skills. You can get more tips in this section.

**NOTE**: Armenian companies are not in the habit of long-distance recruitment. If they raise an employee, they expect you to hire immediately. At the most, you'll have 2 weeks before you should be ready to begin.
