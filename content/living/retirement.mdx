# Retirement in Armenia

Retiring in Armenia is a popular choice for many repatriates.

## Pension System

*   **Basic Pension**: ~36,000 AMD (minimum). Average is ~50,000 AMD.
*   **Eligibility**: Foreigners with residency/citizenship can receive a pension if they have worked in Armenia for at least **10 years**.
*   **Application**: Apply at the Social Security Service with ID, SSN, and proof of work experience.

*   **Home Care**: Hiring nurses/caretakers is affordable (500-800 AMD/hour).
