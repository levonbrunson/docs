## Divorce

The end of a marriage can be quite painful, and not all parties will always agree to it. In Armenia, so long as both consent to the act, their divorce is carried out in the body of the civil status acts registration. Should one of the parties be declared missing or having no legal capacity, as well as incarcerated for over three years' time, the divorce may go through on one application. Furthermore, if one of the spouses is unable to make it, his or her signature on the application must be notarized to be accepted by the courts. It would be carried out by the courts in general, should there not be consent from one spouse or he/she doesn't follow through, or both wish to take it to court. If it is through this method, then the divorce is finalized upon judgement. In both cases, the divorce will be registered officially.

Divorce can be processed through the **Civil Registry Office** or the **Courts**.
