## Marriage
Marriage in Armenia is a voluntary union between a man and a woman (18+ years old).

### Requirements
*   **Mutual Consent**: Both parties must be present. Proxy marriages are prohibited.
*   **Restrictions**: No polygamy, marriage between immediate family members (parents, grandparents, siblings), first cousins from either side of the family tree, or incapacitated persons.
*   **Same-Sex Marriage**: A marriage is between a man and a woman in Armenia. No same-sex or cohabitation relationships can be viewed as marriage or recognized as such, at the moment.

<Note>
**Foreign Citizens & Diaspora**: Foreign citizens, stateless persons, and Armenian citizens residing in foreign countries may marry in Armenia with permission from the Head of the Civil Status Acts Registration Agency of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Armenia.
</Note>

### Registration Process
1.  **Apply**: Submit an application to the **Civil Status Acts Registration Agency** (Ministry of Justice) electronically or at service centers.
    
    <Info>
    **Government Hours**: All government agencies have a lunch break from 13:00 to 14:00.
    </Info>
    
2.  **Documents Needed**:
    *   Passports/ID cards.
    *   Proof of termination of previous marriage (divorce decree/death certificate), if applicable.
    *   For foreigners: Document certifying marital status from their country of permanent residence.
3.  **Ceremony Location**: Both parties must be present at the signing. If there is a specific reason why either party cannot be present (illness, etc.), the ceremony may be conducted in their home or medical institution.
4.  **Surnames**: Spouses can keep their own, take the other's, or hyphenate (if single surnames).
5.  **Fees**: No state duty is envisaged for registration of a marriage.

<Note>
In case of submitting the application on state registration of marriage through an authorized person, the application containing information on marital status, filled out by the person entering into marriage, is also submitted through the approved notarial procedure.
</Note>

**Note**: Only state-registered marriages are legally valid. Church weddings alone do not carry legal weight. Cohabitation without official registration does not carry any legal responsibility.

<Note>
**Property Rights**: All property acquired after marriage belongs to both spouses unless otherwise specified in a signed contract. Personal property acquired before marriage is treated separately.
</Note>

### Invalid Marriages

A marriage may be considered invalid when:

*   The couple is under the age of 18 and there is no consent by the parents.
*   One partner is 16, but the other is over 18, despite having parental consent.
*   One spouse is already married (polygamy).
*   The spouses are immediate or adopted close relatives.
*   Either of the spouses is recognized as invalid by the court and unable to make decisions.
*   Either of the spouses have concealed STDs or drug/other toxic addictions.
*   It's discovered that one of the spouses shows no intention to make a family (false marriage).

<Note>
**Equal Rights for Non-Citizens**: The Armenian constitution prevents discrimination. As such, non-citizens are provided the same rights and obligations as locals in divorce proceedings.
</Note>

## Divorce

The end of a marriage can be quite painful, and not all parties will always agree to it. In Armenia, so long as both consent to the act, their divorce is carried out in the body of the civil status acts registration. Should one of the parties be declared missing or having no legal capacity, as well as incarcerated for over three years' time, the divorce may go through on one application. Furthermore, if one of the spouses is unable to make it, his or her signature on the application must be notarized to be accepted by the courts. It would be carried out by the courts in general, should there not be consent from one spouse or he/she doesn't follow through, or both wish to take it to court. If it is through this method, then the divorce is finalized upon judgement. In both cases, the divorce will be registered officially.

<Note>
**No Legal Separation**: There is no legal "separation" within Armenian society. There is also no such thing as "cohabitation rights" from which to release a couple. Divorce is the only legal means to dissolve a marriage.
</Note>

Divorce can be processed through the **Civil Registry Office** or the **Courts**.
